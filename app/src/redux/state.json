/*
This json outlines the structure of the global Redux state.
Every entry into the state should be of the following form:
{
  ...,
  "key": default_value  // (type) - used to track state
}
For example, if I was to store an authentication token for server in state,
then that entry would look like...
{
  ...,
  "auth_token": null  // (string) - authentication token for server
}
*/
{}
